This app is for League of Legends players to help them to get information about each other.

I am a begginner in Java app development and this is the first fully application I have made with Java. It has so many unneccessary code lines that needs to be fixed. However, now I work with Flutter/Dart. So, I don`t think I will update this app any more.

If you guys are trying to learn how to fetch data from a server by API`s in Java, you can consider my codes as a good example for it.
